    <h2>Milo</h2>

	<p>This is my pet dog Milo. He is at least part australian shepard, though I don't recall what else. We've had him for about 7-ish years.</p>
	<p>We got him from a scout leader who takes in rescues. We had met him months before, but it was a while before we were able to get him.
	<p>He likes laying around us and looking out the window. He used to go around outside alone alot, but he recently hurt his leg so we can't let him do that anymore.</p>
	<h2>Harry</h2>

	<p>This is my pet cat Harry. We got him a little after we got Milo.</p>
	<p>My mother found him outside as a kitten and brought him in for what she swore would be just a day or so.</p>
	<p>We still let him out alone as we havn't had any problems with him so far. Though, he never wants to go out once it gets cold.</p>
	<h2>Daisy</h2>
	<img src="images/daisy_pic.jpg" alt="A picture of my grandmother's dog">
	<p>This is my grandmother's pet dog Daisy. While she's not technically our pet, she did live with us for the past few months so I'm adding her.
	<p>My grandmother got her from a pet store I'm pretty sure.</p>
	<p>She really likes my grandmother, to the point where she pretty much will never leave her side for long.</p>
