    <p>This is my pet dog Milo. He is at least part australian shepard, though I don't recall what else. We've had him for about 7 &#x2d ish years.</p>
    <p>We got him from a scout leader who takes in rescues. We had met him months before, but it was a while before we were able to get him.
    <p>He likes laying around us and looking out the window. He used to go around outside alone a lot, but he recently hurt his leg so we can't let him do that anymore.</p>
    <h2>Harry</h2>
    <div class="pet-div">
      <div class="double-pet-images">
        <img id="harry-pic1" src="images/harry_pic_1.JPG" alt="A picture of my cat">

      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This is my pet cat Harry. We got him a little after we got Milo.</p>
    <p>My mother found him outside as a kitten and brought him in for what she swore would be just a day or so.</p>
    <p>We still let him out alone as we havn't had any problems with him so far. Though, he never wants to go out once it gets cold.</p>
    <h2>Daisy</h2>
    <div class="pet-div">
      <div class="single-pet-image">
        <img id= "daisy-pic1" src="images/daisy_pic.JPG" alt="A picture of my grandmother's dog">
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>This is my grandmother's pet dog Daisy. While she's not technically our pet, she did live with us for the past few months so I'm adding her.
    <p>My grandmother got her from a pet store I'm pretty sure.</p>
    <p>She really likes my grandmother, to the point where she pretty much will never leave her side for long.</p>
