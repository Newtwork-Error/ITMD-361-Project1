    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Deltarune is a fun little RPG made by Toby Fox, the developer of Undertale. Chapter 1 came out October 31, 2018 and Chapter 2 came out September 17, 2021. It's broadly a story about a group of students who gain access to a secret other world called the dark world and have some adventures. A lot of the characters in the real world are characters from Undertale, but none of the major characters are. Currently 2 out of the planned 7 chapters have been released.</p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 1</h3>
    <p>Chapter 1 starts with the player, playing Kris, and one of their classmates, Susie, finding a hidden world in the school's supply closet. The world is based on basic table top games, with a lot of the characters being cards, chess peices, or the like. Kris and Susie, with the help of a citizen of the dark world, named Ralsie, travel through the dark world to seal the "dark fountain" at the end and make it back home.</p>
    <h3>Chapter 2</h3>
    <p>The next day Kris and Susie spend some time hanging out with Ralsie in the dark world in the supply closet. However, Ralsie finds out they have a school project to do and forces them to leave and be productive. Kris and Susie head to the library to find that the computer lab has turned into a new dark world, which they enter. They find out that two other students in their class have now also been trapped in the dark world, and they go on another adventure to once again seal this world's dark fountain. This dark world is all based on computer equipment and the internet, with characters like viruses or mice.</p>
    <h2>Speedrunning</h2>
    <p>Speedruns of these games are the main way I still enjoy them. Runs can consist of chapter 1 or 2 individually, or both of them together. A new skip was found for chapter 2 that I think is cool &#x2f amusing so I'm adding it here.</p>
    <h3>Bagel Skip</h3>
    <p>Near the beginning of the game, there is a minor gag where a sales robot offers to sell you 400 bagels. If you buy them, the game fades to black and pretends that many bagels crushed you to death. It then returns to normal gamplay. If you interact with the door by them right after the cutscene happens, the text overflows and you can warp to the mansion, which is the last area in the chapter.</p>
